Stacks = LIFO
last in first out
INSERTION/DELETION - O(1)constant time/space insertion and deletion
can be implemented with a dynamic array
push pop
SEARCHING - O(N) time, O(1) space
PEEK - O(1)

Queues = FIFO
first in first out
INSERTION/DELETION - O(1) constant time/space insertion and deletion
SEARCHING - O(N) time, O(1) space
PEEK - O(1)
can be implemented with a linked list - if you have head and tail, you can enqueue and dequeue

maxStack and minStack
priorityQueue
