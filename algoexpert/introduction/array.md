ACCESS - O(1)
UPDATE - O(1)
INSERT - O(N)
INSERT END DYNAMIC - O(1)
REMOVE - O(N)
REMOVE END - O(1)
COPY - O(N)

dynamic array - allocate double the space of memory slot, so you can freely append things at the end at O(1) time
amortized analysis - you doubling at O(N) at worst case, but mostly it's considered as constant time
