BIG O Notation - time/space complexity of algorithms at a AVG WORST CASE SCENARIO

Asymptotic analysis - the speed of algorithm as N increases to infinity
    - only cares about significant expression
    - remove constants
    - exponents don't count as a constant

If you have two inputs 
O(M + N)
O(M^2 + N) ---> you want to keep both since they are different variables
O(N! + log(M) + 2N + 8) ---> O(N! + log(M))
