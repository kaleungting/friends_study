INNER JOIN shows matching entries on both of the table, it excludes if it doesnt


LEFT JOIN shows all of the record from the FROM table but not from the joined table
    - keeps whatever is on the left side (KEEPS TBLCOUNTRY)
    SELECT * FROM TBLCOUNTRY 
    LEFT JOIN TBLESTATE 
    ON 
    TBLCOUNTRY.CountryId = TBLSTATE.CountryId


RIGHT JOIN - keeps whatever is on the right table (the joined table)
- keeps all records on TBLSTATE
    SELECT * FROM TBLCOUNTRY 
    RIGHT JOIN TBLESTATE 
    ON 
    TBLCOUNTRY.CountryId = TBLSTATE.CountryId

FULL OUTER JOIN - INNER JOIN + LEFT JOIN + RIGHT JOIN
- includes all records (and includes non matching too)
