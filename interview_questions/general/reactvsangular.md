React vs Angular

LIBRARY VS FULLBLOWN FRAMEWORK

Angular MVC framework

- real dom - whole data structure/tree is updated even if a single section is updated
- full blown framework
- lots of built in features, even if you dont need to use all of it
- barrier of entry higher, more to learn
- two way data binding

React - view library

- virtual dom - faster because it doesnt affect other part of the tree
- more minimalistic, freedom of choosing libraries is fun, allows tailoring to particular projecgts
- jsx built on top of JS
- class based components with lifecycle hooks and functional components too
- utilities for unit-testing components
- hooks makes things very easy and offers an alternative
- barrier of entry lower
- one way data banding
