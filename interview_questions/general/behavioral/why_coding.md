Why did you get into coding?
Most programmers will probably remember the first time they ran their code to print out "Hello World". 
I remember writing mine after attending a "Disruptive Technology Meeting" while I was still a project manager on
the Asset Servicing Team at BNY Mellon just a little over a year ago. Initially, I took on coding so that I could
prepare for the disruptive change in the financial industry. Many of our clients were moving from big traditional
financial institutions and into smaller and leaner fin-tech companies. 

- joy in bringing things from code to screen
- card game project, that we play in our friend group, turned it into a application
- realize how much more fun it is to create something that falls into our consumers hands and getting feedback

As I started diving deeper in to coding, I found joy in bringing things from code to life on screen. my first project was building a card game that my friend had designed that we play in our friend group. It was a simple game where there's a deck of cards with questions and actions, and we pass the phone around and if it's question card, we answer it and if it's an action card, we'll have to perform it. And this was a game that we actually play amongst our friends til this day (although virtually now). and i realize how much more fun it was to be able to create something that falls into our consumers hand and getting feedback for it.
