I'm currently a software engineer for a nonprofit organization called The Giving Grape. It's a start-up that came in response to the pandemic, and it aims to provide grocery store gift cards to individuals and families struggling in America. I've been there for a little over seventh months and I've helped build a lot of the features from the ground up, such as the sign-up process, categories filter for donation, and working to incorporate a number of apis to our web app. And because it's such a new organization, a lot of thinking has to be done before development such as trade-offs, wireframing, working with the UX-UI team. This was my first role outside of AppAcademy, a coding bootcamp where I was able to really hone my skills as a developer while working on a number of different projects which i've listed out on my resume. and it's been a great experience bc I've been able to help a lot of people while learning a lot of new technologies. But prior to coding, I was a project manager at the Bank of New York Mellon for 3.5 years working on client onboarding and asset conversions for the banks. So I do have a lot of experience working on projects with lots of teams and moving pieces and it's been very useful with the way i work with team members on projects and code. I'm happy to go in depth with any of the things i've just mentioned.
