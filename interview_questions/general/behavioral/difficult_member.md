DIFFICULT TEAM MEMBER/COMMUNICATION
S: 
As a project manager, my role is to work on projects with a lot of different stakeholders. each stakeholders have their own project and goals in mind.

T: there was one particular project I remember where there was a bottleneck with a specific team, calls after calls, the team was showing up with no results and we were approaching a deadline for the project.

A:
sat down with the team to understand what the bottleneck was. i didnt want to call the team out in the group meeting because I know that wasn't going to lead anywhere. so i scheduled a one on one meeting with the person on the team, and on the call i found out that he was having trouble doing something and it was hard for him to admit that on the call, and even though I was not an expert, as a PM i had a network of people i could connect him with, and so i connected him with another person to help him out.


R:
this made me realize how important it is to directly connect with each team member on the project, and ensure that a team member's success ensures the entire team's success.  we were able to ship the product out to the client on time and received positive feedback on a $5 million dollar deal
