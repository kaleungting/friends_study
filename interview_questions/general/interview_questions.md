What are you looking for in your next role?

3 things i look for in my next role
    - be in a company or a team that cultivates a learning environment
      - i do understand that i come from a non traditional software engineering background
      - i want to be able to demonstrate my willingness to learn and it's important for my next role at any company to support an environment like that
    - collaborative environment
      - in addition, being able to work in a cohesive unit is very important, working at TGG as a software engineer and through the group project at AppAcademy i realized more than ever how important it is for the team 
    - career growth and upward trajectory
      - as much as I am willing to put in the time/hours for a company, i want to see that have a good return on investment for my career growth, and being in a role where there's a good balance of that is important to me


Why Bloomberg
    - first exposure to bloomberg was when i was working on the trading floor during my rotational program at BNYM
    - second exposure was when I was at AppAcademy, and I spoke with some alumnis and they talked about how bloomberg really cultivated a learning environment and how they help their software engineers grow.
    - and as i got further along the interview process, i spoke with others who interviewed at the company and they all talked about how collaborative the experience felt, and i think that translates really well into what the work environment will be. and that's something that drew me more and more towards the role and the company
