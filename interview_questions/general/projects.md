Rater App
    pros:
        - google maps API
        - fullstack, created a backend database through ruby on rails and seeing it connect to the frontend through react/redux;
        - Create, Read, Update, Delete business reviews
    cons:
    why: allowed, me to use Google API, AWS to store a ton of photos, full CRUD capabilities allowing me to use SQL queries to filter restaurants by price/food category, etc. it was a very involved fullstack project (2 weeks)
    - cloning a website definitely helped me appreciate all of the little details that i didnt know as a user on the other end

    pros:
        - stripe API, learning a new api is fun
        - google firebase authentication - created the whole userAuth on Rater, but learned how to recreate something super quickly using a new technology
      - 
    cons:
    why: it was a project i took on outside of appacademy to pursuit more advance technology and coding practice, to learn modern react technology such as react hooks, selectors, styled components
        benefits of react hooks
        benefits of selectors - it memoizes mapStateToProps, so it doesn't recomputes every time a state that doesn't involve them changes. it optimizes the project
            - i could have benefitted from learning this earlier during my Fullstack Yelp Project, since i dont think it's fully optimize and i have a huge database of restaurants/reviews stored in it. 
        benefits of styled components 
            - dont have to worry about naming of classes if working on a big project
            - dynamic styling, i can add javascript in it, less if/else statements within my React Component (most of the heavy lifting on the style can be done in the stylesheets);

    pros:
        - worked on a team
        - project manager experience (we all had our own roles, I was backend engineer, connected Spoonacular API and stored data into MongoDB)
        - it was a bit hectic, so I used Asana to manage the project and assigned tasks to make the workflow more efficient
    cons:
