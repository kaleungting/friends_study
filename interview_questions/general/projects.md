Rater App
    pros:
        - google maps API
        - fullstack, created a backend database through ruby on rails and seeing it connect to the frontend through react/redux;
        - Create, Read, Update, Delete business reviews
    cons:
    why: allowed, me to use Google API, AWS to store a ton of photos, full CRUD capabilities allowing me to use SQL queries to filter restaurants by price/food category, etc. it was a very involved fullstack project (2 weeks)
    - cloning a website that i liked definitely helped me appreciate all of the little details that i didnt know as a user on the other end

    pros:
        - stripe API, learning a new api is fun
        - google firebase authentication - created the whole userAuth on Rater, but learned how to recreate something super quickly using a new technology
      - 
    cons:
    why: it was a project i took on outside of appacademy to pursuit more advance technology and coding practice, to learn modern react technology such as react hooks, selectors, styled components
        benefits of react hooks - readability and reusability (it makes code more dry and worry less about the different lifecycle of a component)
        benefits of selectors - it memoizes mapStateToProps, so it doesn't recomputes every time a state that doesn't involve them changes. it optimizes the project
            - i could have benefitted from learning this earlier during my Fullstack Yelp Project, since i dont think it's fully optimize and i have a huge database of restaurants/reviews stored in it. 
        benefits of styled components 
            - dont have to worry about naming of classes if working on a big project
            - dynamic styling, i can add javascript in it, less if/else statements within my React Component (most of the heavy lifting on the style can be done in the stylesheets);

    pros:
    draw up a concept
    designate roles
        - worked on a team
        - project manager experience (we all had our own roles, I was backend engineer, connected Spoonacular API and stored data into MongoDB)
        - it was a bit hectic at first since it was everyone's first time working on an app as a team, so I used Asana to manage the project and assigned tasks to make the workflow more efficient
    cons:
        - 

Things i would have done differently
    - research on newer technology, chances are as time goes on, newer technology will make life simpler and code easier to write
      - react hooks, styled components, selectors
    - commenting as i code, when i first started on my fullstack, all i had in mind was to get things on the page and write functional code
        - it's important for code to be readable and reusable (whether that means someone else reading your code or if you're revisiting old code that you've written)
        - working at the giving grape has taught me that, looking at someone's code is not always the easiest thing to do, but if code is well documented, then it makes making changes for you and for the next person a lot easier

The Giving Grape -
    - first time jumping into a project that wasn't built from scratch
      - it took a lot of time trying to understand code written by someone else
      - taught me the importance of documentation and commenting as you code so it becomes more readable and reusable for you and for the next person
    - Asana to keep track of tasks;
      - was a good way to distribute work and keep everyone accountable;
