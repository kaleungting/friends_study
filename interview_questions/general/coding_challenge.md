Things To Do:

Pre-Coding
    - ask question about the question, try to really find out what it's doing
      - ask for sample input and output
    - confirm with the interviewer to see if your understanding of the question is accurate
    - identify what the arguments are (what does the function take in? an array, integer?)
    - think about the edge cases
      - ask interviewer what it wants to return if edge cases (null, false, -1?)
      - but don't worry about solving it until later, focus on solving the problem first

    - talk about what you are thinking and how you want to go about solving it (keep asking interviewer if he/she thinks "WE'RE" going in the right direction)
    - highlight time complexity and whether or not you're trying to brute force it, or if you have an optimized solution
    - if u already know the optimized solution, just briefly talk about the brute force and how doing it this way is better
      - ask the interviewer if he thinks it'll work, and if you get the green light, then you can say you'll start pseudocoding

    - pseudocode
      - write out the steps, what data structure you're creating at every step, what the behavior it's doing at every step
      - ask interviewer what they think and whether or not "WE'RE" going the right direction
    
    - let the interviewer know when you're ready to start coding

Coding
    - talk through each line of code
    - feel free to comment on what each line of code is doing, run it against what you had in your pseudocode
    - after you finish coding, talk through your code line by line, explaining what is happening there
    - ask the interviewer what he/she thinks and if this solution is similar to what they are looking for
    - write down the Time/Space complexity
      - comment in, where the time complexities are at each step of the code
      - think about if there's way to optimize it
  
Ask the interviewer what he/she thought and how they would have done things differently
