NOT(~) The complement of the number, it flips everything
N = 5 = 101
~N = 2 = 010

AND(&): USE & to check if an integer is 0 or 1
0 & 0: 0
0 & 1: 0
1 & 1: 1

OR(|)
0 | 0: 0
0 | 1: 1
1 | 1: 1

XOR(^):
0 ^ 0: 0
0 ^ 1: 1
1 ^ 1: 0

LEFT SHIFT(<<): shifts to the left and append 0 to the end
1 << 1 = 2 = 2**1  01 becomes 10
1 << 2 = 4 = 2**2  01 becomes 100
1 << 3 = 8 = 2**3 01 becomes 1000
1 << 4 = 16 = 2**4 01 becomes 10000

RIGHT SHIFT(>>): shifts to the right and append 1 at the end
4 >> 1 = 2 
0011

100 & 011 000
