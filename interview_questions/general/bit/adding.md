Inverse Bit
12  = 00001100
       1110100 
take the first 7 digits = = 0001100
write its inverse =         1110011
add one to it =          (1)1110100
negative numbers will start with 1

-12 = 11110100

in order to find an inverse bit, take the first 7 digits and then write it's inverse (aka switch the 1s and the 0s and then add 1)

00010111 = 23

LEFT SHIFT multiply by 2
(0) 00101110 = 46, move everything to the left and then truncate the front


RIGHT SHIFT divide by 2
00001011(1) = 11, move everything to to right, add a zero to the beginning and truncate the end
