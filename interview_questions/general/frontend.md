CSS specificity

- when you have conflicting css rules that point to the same element, the one that is more specific will apply
- inline, id, classes/attrs, elements

Waterfall or Agile
Banking App vs Social Media App
Healthcare Startup vs Video Player
tolerance of quality 

incubate vs iterate (quality vs speed)
incubate - thinking everything through before doing it
iterate - smaller increments of stuff you can finish and push, faster product to market that's mroe durable and flexible because there's a development cycle that changes

agile iteration is work through sprints (4-6 weeks) - incremental releases
requirements - when it's completed, how long it takes and if it's dependent
tickets - tracking and commented 
once sprint is closed, 

stand ups


waterfall is top down, 
analysis, design, implement, testing, maintenance
