Code can be reused through inheritance thereby reducing redundancy
Data and code are bound together by encapsulation
OOPs allows data hiding, therefore, private data is kept confidential
Problems can be divided into different parts making it simple to solve
The concept of polymorphism gives flexibility to the program by allowing the entities to have multiple forms

4. What are the main features of OOPs?
