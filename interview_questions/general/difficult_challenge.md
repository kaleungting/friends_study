The Giving Grape

Situation: the tech lead was moving out of the role and into a full-time position, I have background in PM during my time at the bank, i had to step in as tech lead

Task: we had a donee class login but we wanted to build a donor type log-in, this would be a big overhaul for our project
- initially everyone was very compartmentalized 

Action: 
- used Asana to assign tasks and manage deadlines
- build out UI/UX team
- troubleshooting and debugging with software engineers
- creating documentation practice while coding to ensure transition is easy for new engineers and for others checking their work

Result: After two months we were able ot role out this feature. this was a feature that was pushed back by several tech leads before me because of how big of an overhaul it is to our current system
