Dynamic Programming - 
caching answers computed previously so you dont need to do duplicate work

understand the sub-problems

TIME/SPACE TRADE-OFF

top-down approach - memoization

bottom-up approach - tabulation
create an array of size n+1


fibonacci 
Time Complexity - O(2^N)
Space Complexity - O(N)

memoized
Time Complexity - O(N)
Space Complexity - O(N)
